# Seeds Dataset (UCI)

This repository contains the Seeds Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 210 samples and 7 attributes:
- Area
- Perimeter
- Compactness
- Length of kernel
- Width of kernel
- Asymmetry coefficient
- Length of kernel groove

## Files

- `Seeds_UCI_Dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and visualization.
- `seeds.zip`: Zipped file containing the dataset in CSV format.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Itskindastrange/Seeds-Dataset-UCI.git
    ```
2. Unzip the dataset file:
    ```bash
    unzip seeds.zip
    ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
